/**
 * Entry point for the Whale Base application.
 * <p>
 * This class just kicks things off and launches the GUI. When the program
 * starts, {@link #main(String[])} is called, and from there we spin up the
 * {@link WhaleBaseGUI} on the Swing event dispatch thread (EDT).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Role in the overall system:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Acts as the starting point of the app.</li>
 *     <li>Boots up the graphical user interface instead of a console menu.</li>
 *     <li>Makes sure the GUI is created in a thread-safe way using Swing’s
 *         {@code invokeLater}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Typical usage:</b> You don’t normally call this class directly in code.
 * You just run the program, and the JVM calls {@code main} for you:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // From the command line:
 * // java Main
 *
 * // Or in an IDE, just hit "Run" on Main.
 * }</pre>
