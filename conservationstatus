/**
 * Represents the different conservation status categories a whale species can have.
 * <p>
 * These labels give us a quick idea of how at-risk a species is, and they're used
 * across the system anywhere we need to sort or group whales based on how threatened
 * they are. By using an enum instead of raw text, the app stays consistent and avoids
 * issues like typos or mismatched phrases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>How this fits into the app:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Each {@link Whale} stores one of these values to describe its status.</li>
 *     <li>{@code AppController} converts whatever the user types (like "endangered") into
 *         one of these enum constants so everything stays uniform.</li>
 *     <li>The conservation overview feature groups whales by these categories.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Quick example:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Whale grayWhale = new Whale(
 *     "ESCHRICHTIUS_ROBUSTUS",
 *     "Eschrichtius robustus",
 *     List.of("Gray Whale"),
 *     14.0,
 *     30000.0,
 *     ConservationStatus.VULNERABLE,
 *     List.of("Coastal Waters")
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Overall, this enum keeps everything organized and makes it easy to compare species
 * or run simple stats based on their conservation level.
 * </p>
