/**
 * Represents the conservation status categories used for whale species in the system.
 * <p>
 * This enum follows common ecological classification terms, giving each whale a clear
 * status that reflects how threatened the species is. These values are used throughout
 * the app—especially in {@code AppController} and {@link Whale}—to sort, categorize,
 * and filter species for conservation-related features.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>How it's used in the system:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link Whale} stores one of these values for each species.</li>
 *     <li>{@code AppController} converts user input (like "Endangered") into the correct enum.</li>
 *     <li>Methods like {@code conservationOverview()} group species by these categories.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This enum allows the system to enforce a consistent set of allowed conservation
 * labels instead of relying on free-typed text from the user.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Whale blueWhale = new Whale(
 *     "BALAENOPTERA_MUSCULUS",
 *     "Balaenoptera musculus",
 *     List.of("Blue Whale"),
 *     30.0,
 *     150000.0,
 *     ConservationStatus.ENDANGERED,
 *     List.of("Open Ocean")
 * );
 * }</pre>
